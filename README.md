# Transfer_Matrix_Method_TMM
MATLAB codes to implement the transfer matrix method used to model the propagation of light in isotropic, stratified media. It includes the option to work with layers where the light propagates incoherently, and to work with layers with more than one material through the Effective Medium Approximation (EMA).
